	doi = {10.1016/j.dsr2.2006.11.013},
	abstract = {It is generally assumed that the extreme life history traits of pelagic seabirds, such as low fecundity or slow growth of chicks, result from the difﬁculties obtaining energy at sea from unpredictable and patchily distributed resources. However, little information on seabird prey distribution and availability exists to sustain this widely accepted hypothesis. Using tracking studies of 68 sub-populations of ﬂying seabirds, I examine whether it is possible to gain information on the predictability of their marine resources. Because prey are clustered from ﬁne to large scale in nested unities, from swarms to patches and concentrations of patches, it is important to take into account spatial scale. In temperate and polar regions, at large and meso-scales, seabirds appear to have a good knowledge of the location and concentrations of patches and generally use a commuting type of trip to reach foraging zones. Predictability appears to be high at large and meso-scales, with individuals from each sub-population heading in a particular direction from the colony to reach favoured habitats of known enhanced productivity such as shelf edges, frontal zones, upwellings. Within these mesoscale features, the animals use an area-restricted search behaviour to search for patches and swarms at ﬁner scales. Using information on foraging site ﬁdelity of individual birds, I show that differences in predictability at coarse scales are related to the distance and time spent foraging, and in particular to the speciﬁc types of foraging habitat. Some habitats appear to be more predictable than others: birds return consistently to the same coarse-scale sectors on shelf edges, whereas predictability is low in oceanic waters, even in frontal zones. Preliminary results on tropical species suggest that the environment here is less predictable in tropic than in temperate or polar zones. This review highlights that patchiness and predictability of marine resources are complex notions: predictability is dependent on the spatial and temporal scale considered, and especially on the marine habitat of foraging interest. I discuss the potential consequences of these results for the breeding success and life history of seabirds.},

	abstract = {Seabird foraging behaviour can reflect prey abundance at sea, and is influenced by stress hormone levels, thus providing a potential indicator of at-sea conditions. Using common diving petrels (Pelecanoides urinatrix, hereafter CDPs), a procellariform that preferentially forages on crustacean zooplankton, we sought to understand how spatially separate colonies responded behaviourally and physiologically to contrasting prey levels with a view to recruiting this species as an environmental indicator. In 2016, incubating CDPs from Tiritiri Matangi (− 36.59S; 174.88E, low levels of preferred prey) and Burgess (− 35.91S; 174.12E, high levels of preferred prey) Islands within the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, were tracked using GPS devices. We hypothesised that Tiritiri birds would exhibit greater foraging effort and higher stress hormone levels across the breeding season due to lower levels of available prey. Hidden Markov methods were used to model foraging effort, and prey trophic level (stable isotopes: δ13C and δ15N) and stress hormone levels (CORT) quantified in plasma samples. During incubation birds were spatially segregated when foraging. Tiritiri birds exerted more effort, chasing higher trophic level prey at larger distances from the colony, and had higher body weight and lower CORT than Burgess birds. However, bird CORT levels responded more to reproductive duties (peaking during chick rearing) as opposed to colony location, i.e. CORT was not consistently higher in Tiritiri birds. Although a snapshot, our findings illustrate the promise of integrating multiple parameters when recruiting seabirds as ocean indicators, resulting in improved resolution of future monitoring programmes based upon them.},

Here we compared the foraging strategy of a pantropical seabird, the red-footed booby Sula sula, in 5 populations breeding in contrasted environmental conditions. The foraging strategy strongly differed between sites, from strictly diurnal short trips in Europa Island (Mozambique channel) to long trips including up to 5 nights at sea in Genovesa Island (Galapagos archipelago). The Expectation Maximisation binary Clustering (EMbC) algorithm was used to determine the different behaviours of individuals during their foraging trips (travelling, intensive foraging, resting and relocating). During the day, the activity budget was similar for all the breeding colonies. During the night, birds were primarily on the water, drifting with currents. At all sites, birds similarly performed intensive foraging in zones of area-restricted search (ARS), although the size and duration of ARS zones differed markedly. Red-footed boobies foraged over deep oceanic waters, with chlorophyll a concentrations varying between sites. Birds did not appear to target areas with higher productivity. We suggest that range differences between populations may be linked to other factors such as intra- and interspecific competition.},

We show in this context that the Maximum Entropy paradigm for IRL lends itself naturally to the efﬁcient training of deep architectures. At test time, the approach leads to a computational complexity independent of the number of demonstrations, which makes it especially well-suited for applications in life-long learning scenarios. Our approach achieves performance commensurate to the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks while exceeding on an alternative benchmark based on highly varying reward structures.Finally, we extend the basic architecture - which is equivalent to a simpliﬁed subclass of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with width one - to include larger convolutions in order to eliminate dependency on precomputed spatial features and work on raw input representations.},

	title = {Movement models provide insights into variation in the foraging effort of central place foragers},
	abstract = {Ecology and conservation depend on an understanding of how animals adjust their behaviour patterns in response to changes in their environment. Central place foragers (CPFs) are well-suited for developing ecological models of adaptive processes because their objective functions and operational constraints can be reasonably inferred. Central place foraging and provisioning theory provide the theoretical framework for this analysis. Analysis of CPF time allocation and energy budgets can provide insights into their strategies for responding to environmental variation. However, until recently, suitable high-resolution data on the behaviour of seabirds and other CPFs at sea have not been available. Previous studies of breeding seabirds have investigated variation in foraging trip duration and colony attendance, but few studies have analyzed variation in time allocation within foraging trips. Here, we develop a conceptual energy-based model for analysing variation in the time allocation of CPFs during foraging trips, and apply it to the movement patterns of Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata). Foraging trips of Peruvian boobies, recorded using high-resolution global positioning systems (GPS), were ﬁrst partitioned into movement modes consistent with travel and foraging behaviours using a hidden Markov model (HMM) adapted to account for gaps in the GPS tracks associated with diving behaviour. Analysis of the HMM results based on the conceptual model indicated that differences in foraging effort between two treatments were best explained by a combination of differences in travel time and in time spent searching for prey. The conceptual model provides the basis for an integrated approach to analysis of variation in foraging strategies in which identiﬁcation of various behaviours is coupled with assessments of time and energy budgets. This integrated approach can contribute to greater understanding of the processes determining foraging strategies and the limits to these strategies in the context of competition for resources and global climate change.},

	abstract = {The South Pacific Gyre has the most hyper-oligotrophic waters in the world and is considered the largest “oceanic desert.” Rapa Nui (Easter Island), located within the South Pacific Gyre, is a breeding ground for masked boobies (Sula dactylatra), which are seabirds with a foraging range that effectively confines them within the gyre. The foraging ecology of this species in the gyre was examined by attaching GPS and time-depth devices to chick-rearing adult birds (9 and 14 birds in 2016 and 2017, respectively) and by collecting regurgitates (18 and 15 samples in 2016 and 2017, respectively). In addition, the birds’ foraging ecology between years was compared. Masked boobies traveled in various directions, dived at unspecific locations, and explored areas {\textless} 110 km from the colony. Local environmental conditions were not significantly different between years, and differences in foraging parameters (maximum foraging range, trip duration, and dive depth) were greater among individuals than between years. The foraging characteristics of masked boobies suggest that resources were ephemerally distributed around the colony, with similar abundances across years. Under these conditions, traveling to unspecific locations may increase the area covered and the probability of prey encounter. The spatial and temporal consistencies in environmental conditions explain the uniformity of foraging parameters between years. The ability of masked boobies to exploit ephemerally distributed resources in seascapes like Rapa Nui may help explain its pantropical distribution.},

	abstract = {The role that population-level competition plays in regulating foraging distributions of colonial breeders has remained elusive because many studies of animal movements in the natural environment focus on relatively small datasets from a single population of animals. Here, we present a large (528 foraging trips, 169 individuals), multi-year, multi-colony GPS tracking dataset mostly collected simultaneously at 4 breeding colonies across the core breeding range of a colonially breeding pelagic seabird, the Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus. Foraging areas were identified by filtering GPS locations (using speed, time of day, and turning angle), validated on a subset of 25 birds carrying co-deployed depth loggers to maximise inclusion of foraging and feeding behaviour. Foraging areas showed high annual variation, but consistent patterns emerged. Birds from each colony consistently foraged locally, showing little overlap between colonies, but birds from all 4 colonies sometimes travelled large distances to forage within a single relatively restricted area. This combined pattern may be driven by density-dependent competition relatively locally, with high overlap and resource sharing at a distance, facilitated by a dual foraging strategy of mixing short and long trips. The key shared area was located near to a tidal front system, the Irish Sea Front, and the stratified waters of the Western Irish Sea to its north and west, which are characterised by high productivity. Visits to this area declined with increasing colony distance, suggesting that foraging advantages are balanced by the energetic costs of travel. Nevertheless, this area is probably of key importance to birds breeding at colonies across the species’ core breeding range, highlighting the potential connectedness, and therefore vulnerability, of a pelagic species via a single foraging location, despite apparent segregation more locally around the breeding colonies.},

	abstract = {Many marine predators coexist at colonies, creating a zone where there could be significant inter- and intraspecific competition. To minimize the potential for direct competition, under the principle of competitive exclusion, sympatric predators may differ in their foraging behaviour at the colony. At Skomer, Wales, razorbills Alca torda and puffins Fratercula arctica both breed at the same time of year, forage on sand eels Ammodytes sp. and their populations are stable or declining, meaning that they may be close to carrying capacity and experiencing competition. To examine how they differ in their foraging behaviour, time-depth-temperature recorders were attached to the legs of chick-rearing individuals of both species. Puffins have lower wingloading and lower total oxygen stores than razorbills and are therefore expected to invest more time in flying and less time in diving than razorbills. Mean (±1 SE) dive depth was 11.8 ± 0.45 m for puffins and 8.2 ± 0.21 m for razorbills, while mean dive duration was 40 ± 0.45 s for puffins and 24 ± 0.21 s for razorbills. Both species spent most of their dive time making shallow, V-shaped dives during daylight hours. In contrast to our prediction, foraging behaviour was very similar between the 2 species, although puffins tended to spend more time both diving and flying. The higher diving and flying rates of puffins may be associated with multiple prey loading, as puffins tend to bring back smaller (and therefore more) prey items than do razorbills.},

The ﬁrst-passage time is deﬁned as the time required for an animal to cross a circle with a given radius. It is a measure of how much time an animal uses within a given area. First-passage time is scale dependent, and a plot of variance in ﬁrst-passage time vs. spatial scale reveals the spatial scale at which the animal concentrates its search effort. By averaging the ﬁrst-passage time on a geographical grid, it is possible to relate ﬁrst-passage time to environmental variables and the search pattern of other individuals.},

	abstract = {We report the ﬁrst successful use of miniature Global Positioning System loggers to track the ocean-going behaviour of a c. 400 g seabird, the Manx Shearwater Pufﬁnus pufﬁnus. Breeding birds were tracked over three ﬁeld seasons during the incubation and chick-rearing periods on their foraging excursions from the large colony on Skomer Island, Pembrokeshire, UK. Foraging effort was concentrated in the Irish Sea. Likely foraging areas were identiﬁed to the north, and more diffusely to the west of the colony. No foraging excursions were recorded signiﬁcantly to the south of the colony, conﬂicting with the conclusions of earlier studies based on ringing recoveries and observations. We discuss several explanations including the hypothesis that foraging may have shifted substantially northwards in recent decades. We found no obvious relationship between birds’ positions and water depth, although there was a suggestion that observations at night were in shallower water than those during the day. We also found that, despite the fact that Shearwaters can be observed rafting off-shore from their colonies in the hours prior to making landfall at night, breeding birds are usually located much further from the colony in the last 8 h before arrival, a ﬁnding that has signiﬁcance for the likely effectiveness of marine protection areas if they are only local to the colony. Short sequences of precise second-by-second ﬁxes showed that movement speeds were bimodal, corresponding to sitting on the water (most common at night and around midday) and ﬂying (most common in the morning and evening), with ﬂight behaviour separable into erratic (indicative of searching for food) and directional (indicative of travelling). We also provide a ﬁrst direct measurement of mean ﬂight speed during directional ﬂight (c. 40 km/h), slower than a Shearwater’s predicted maximum range velocity, suggesting that birds are exploiting wave or dynamic soaring during long-distance travel.},
